Project IV: (Groups 4, 8, and 12)
Stakeholder: Dr. Rania Hodhod - Professor of Computer Science

Project Overview:
You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. The goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model for a retail business to enhance marketing strategies.

Data Sources:
Use the datasets that includes customer demographics, purchase history, and online behavior (consider the attached features, sales, and stores datasets).
Tasks:
Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values, normalization, and feature extraction.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided datasets.
Predict the department-wide sales for each store for the following year
Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks
Provide recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on largest business impact
Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of the models, such as clustering metrics (Silhouette Score) 
Document the methodology, results, and insights gained from the analysis in a comprehensive report.
Include visualizations and discussions on how the segmentation can inform marketing strategies and customer engagement efforts.
Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation summarizing the problem statement, methodology, results, and actionable insights. Emphasize the benefits of using semi-supervised learning for customer segmentation.
